## Troubleshooting and Requesting User Support

It's always appreciated when users [submit an issue](https://github.com/thurianknight/hyp3e/issues/new) for all kinds of user questions, comments, and concerns. For those who prefer support via public chat, we recommend asking in:

- The **#hyperborea-foundry-vtt** channel in the [official North Wind Adventures Discord server](https://discord.gg/YQj5a4z)
- The [/r/FoundryVTT community on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT) may also have answers to your Foundry VTT questions, but it is another general Foundry VTT user community that may not have many users with specific knowledge about HYPERBOREA. Be sure to write `[HYPERBOREA]` in your post subject and select `FVTT Question` from the "Flair" menu.

**We do not offer user support via email. Sorry for the inconvenience.**
