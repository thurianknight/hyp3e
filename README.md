## Troubleshooting and Requesting User Support

It's always appreciated when users [submit an issue](https://github.com/thurianknight/hyp3e/issues/new) for all kinds of user questions, comments, and concerns. For those who prefer support via public chat, we recommend asking in:

- The **#hyperborea-vtt** channel in the [official North Wind Adventures Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/688093166208811100/1274767991371857970)
- The [/r/FoundryVTT community on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT) may also have answers to your Foundry VTT questions, but it is a general Foundry VTT user community that may not have many users with specific knowledge about HYPERBOREA. Be sure to write `[HYPERBOREA]` in your post subject and select `FVTT Question` from the "Flair" menu.
- The [ThurianKnight](https://www.youtube.com/@thurianknight) channel on YouTube has a bunch of videos to help you get up and running quickly!

**We do not offer user support via email. Sorry for the inconvenience.**
